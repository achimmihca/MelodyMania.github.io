## How to Create Workshop Items
- Creating a Workshop item means uploading a folder,
  plus metadata like title, description, and a preview image.
- Melody Mania searches for content in the following subfolders of a Workshop item.
  Prepare your content in these subfolders.
    - `Mods` for [mods](/how-to-mods)
    - `Themes` for themes
    - `PlayerProfileImages` for player profile images
    - `WebViewScripts` for browser scripts
- Navigate to the development options in Melody Mania and click the `Publish Workshop Item` button.
  This will open the upload dialog.
    - Select the folder that should be uploaded and fill the fields for the title, description, etc.
    - Click the `Publish` button to start the upload.
- NOTE: It may take few minutes before a new item appears on the Steam Workshop website.

## How to Edit Workshop Items
- You can only edit your own Workshop items, i.e., items that you have uploaded yourself.
- You need to [subscribe and download](#how-to-use-workshop-items) an item first to edit it.
- Select the Workshop item to be edited in the upload dialog and set only the value of fields that you want to change.
    - Fields that have not been set will not be changed.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <MdxLayoutComponent>{children}</MdxLayoutComponent>
);
