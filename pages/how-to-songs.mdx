# Song Format
Melody Mania supports songs in UltraStar and MIDI format.

- An UltraStar song consists of
    -  an audio file
    -  a plain text file (txt) with information about the song (audio file, artist, title, lyrics, notes, etc.)
    - optionally, image and video files for album art or backgrounds
    - TIP: If your background video has an audio track then it can be used for both, audio file and background video.

- A MIDI file contains
    - music notes to be played
    - optionally, lyrics to be sung
    - TIP: MIDI files with lyrics can be played directly in Melody Mania. All MIDI files can be imported in the editor to create an UltraStar song.

# How to Add Songs
### Download Song Archive
- Melody Mania can download and unpack ZIP and TAR archives with songs directly in-game.
    - TIP: There is an UltraStar [song package](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/songs) with Creative Commons licensed songs that can be added to your library this way
- To download an archive
    - navigate to the song library settings
    - click the button to download songs
    - add the song archive URL
    - start the download
    - NOTE: This will automatically add a new song folder to your local library.

### Add Existing Songs
- If you already have all files of an UltraStar song, you can
    - add a song folder entry in the settings that points to your local song files
        - NOTE: Android requires songs to be stored in special folders for security reasons. The required folder path is device specific and can be found in the song library settings.
    - or store your song under an song folder path

### Create Custom Songs
- You can use the the integrated [song editor](/how-to-song-editor) of Melody Mania to create UltraStar songs of your local song library.

## Limitations / Known Issues

Melody Mania at the moment does not support

- the `P3` notation to specify lyrics for player 1 and player 2 at the same time. As a workaround, you can copy these parts of your song and specify P1 and P2 respectively.
- the `#RELATIVE` tag that changes the semantics of time notation in the file.
